# Shiny Stones ðŸ’Ž

Experiment to use [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber) for a small game.

Conclusion so far; this totally seems to work, react-three-fiber makes dealing with three.js a lot easier!

## Try it out here: https://f25pj.csb.app/

## The code

https://codesandbox.io/s/github/pepf/shiny-stones

## Some things that can be done

- **Gameplay**: Tweaking the game logic further, some combinations shouldn't work.
- **Graphics**: This can shine a lot more than it currently does.
- **Game-ify**: Where's the score mechanism? When is the level done?
